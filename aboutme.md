    I am currently a part of a multidisciplinary design team at the university! We are working in collaboration with TorranceLearning to develop an android application for DEEP at Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum. I am responsible for loading museum developed content into the app through WebView and creating communication channels for the app to respond to bluetooth beacon signals.

    Party Shooter is a video game I have developed in my free time using Unity! The video game supports multiplayer with one computer acting as a host. The game contains fast paced first person gameplay, with players competing to outscore their opponents! You can check it out <a href="https://gsbirch.github.io/partyshooter">here</a>!

### Work Experience
#### Research Intern at U of M (Summer 2023)

The University of Michigan runs the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering (SURE) program each summer. This program employs students to work under doctorate students and professors to assist them in their research.  

In the summer of 2023, I recieved the honor of getting the opportunity to work under Professor Anhong Guo to assist doctorate student Gregory Croisdale with his project "Deckflow". This program offers an intuitive way to use generative image models such as DALL-E with an interface inspired by playing cards. I helped develop the program by developing the interface using React.js and using gesture libraries to handle user input such as scrolling or clicking and dragging.

#### iD Tech Summer Camp Instructor (Summer 2022)

iD Tech Summer Camps are technology camps that teach kids between the ages of 7 and 17 how to code. Camps involve 5 days of project based learning with lunch and outside activity breaks in between.

In the summer of 2022, I worked as a camp instructor at the camps hosted by the University of Cincinnati. I taught children how to use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Animate, as well as how to program in Java, JavaScript, and Lua. I also taught principles in game design and engineering. In addition, I helped students through the other parts of the program, such as getting lunch from the dining hall and heading outside for activites such as kickball.

#### Shift Manager at Sauerbeck Family Drive-In (June 2019 - August 2021)

The Sauerbeck Family Drive-In is a Drive-In Movie Theater located near Louisville, KY. During my time there, the place would serve hundreds of customers each week, presenting blockbuster films and offering a variety of concessions.

The highest promotion I receieved while working at the Sauerbeck Family Drive-In was the position of Shift Manager. I became responsible for delegating the tasks necessary for the place to operate to the other employees working. I also became responsible for ensuring the facility was ready for opening and closing each day I worked.

### Hobbies and Interests
Outside of work and education, I am an avid tabletop game player! I often meet with friends to play Dungeons and Dragons as well as many other board games. I am also a member of the Michigan Marching Band! Fall 2023 will be my 3rd season performing for with the band as part of the horn section! I will also be serving as part of the horn section's student leadership. In my free time, I also enjoy baking, and even won the blue ribbon in my local county fair for my chocolate cake in [2016](https://oldhamcountyextension.com/2016/08/19/2016-oc-fair-winners/)!

### Future Goals and Aspirations
My current goal is to find work as a software engineer in the Louisville area. I am also interested in performing research, with my areas of interest mainly being algorithm design and artifical intelligence.
