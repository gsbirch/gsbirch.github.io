Hello! My name is Gage Birchmeier, and I go by they/them/theirs pronouns. I currently study Computer Science at the University of Michigan, expecting to graduate in December 2023. I am also a member of the Michigan Marching Band! Outside of school, I enjoy playing tabletop games and programming video games.

### Education

I am currently in my 4th year of undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan College of Engineering in Ann Arbor. I am expected to graduate in December 2023 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. My coursework in computer science includes classes covering data structures, algorithms, theory, web development, advanced functional and object oriented programming, artificial intelligence, and human centered software design. I have also completed course work in engineering professionalism and technical communication.

I am currently working on the Digitally Enhanced Exhibit Program (DEEP) with Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum and TorranceLearning as part of my senior capstone. You can read more about that HERE. I am also employed this summer as a research intern in the Human Artificial Intelligence Lab under Dr. Anhong Guo/

    I am currently a part of a multidisciplinary design team at the university! We are working in collaboration with TorranceLearning to develop an android application for the Digitally Enhanced Exhibit Program at Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum. I am responsible for loading museum developed content into the app through WebView and creating communication channels for the app to respond to bluetooth beacon signals.
