Hello! My name is Gage Birchmeier. I currently study Computer Science at the University of Michigan, expected to graduate in December 2023. I am currently looking for work in software development in the Lousiville area.

My coursework in computer science includes classes in Data Structures, algorithms, theory, computer architecture, web development, databases, advanced functional and object oriented programming, and artifical intelligence. During my studies, I have completed a minor in mathematics. I have also completed course work in professionalism and technical communication.

I am currently a part of a multidisciplinary design team at the university! We are working in collaboration with TorranceLearning to develop an android application for the Digitally Enhanced Exhibit Program at Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum. I am responsible for loading museum developed content into the app through WebView and creating communication channels for the app to respond to bluetooth beacon signals.
